<h1>WE ALL USED TO BELIEVE IN MAGIC. EAT THE APPLE. GOLD IS WORTHLESS. COUNT IN EVEN NUMBERS, MULTIPLY BY 5’S. WATCH VIDEOS OF CATS ONLINE. FALL IN LOVE ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT. EVERYTHING OVER MONEY. THE ART OF THE HEIST IS THE GETAWAY. ALL GREAT MEN AND WOMEN HAD TO BE BORN. DON’T WORK YOURSELF DEAD. PLANESPOTTING AND BIRDWATCHING. COLLABORATE, NO REVOLUTION HAPPENED ALONE. SAY YES, LEARN LATER. SAY NO, YOU’RE TIME IS PRICELESS. MONEY IS ONLY NUMBERS AND PAPER, ITS PEOPLE THAT MAKE ITS WORTH. WASH AT 30 DEGREES. DRINK MORE WATER. MAGIC ISN’T MAGIC IF YOU PEOPLE KNOW HOW ITS DONE. KINDNESS MATTERS. THERE ARE MORE STARS IN SPACE THAN GRAINS OF SAND ON EARTH. JOKES AT INNAPROPRIATE TIMES. INDULGE IN AWKWARDNESS. NO GREAT ARTIST EVER HAD A PORTFOLIO. IT WILL ALL BE OK. NO WAR EVER BOUGHT PEACE. EVERYTHING IS A FIGMENT OF OUR IMAGINATION. THERE IS REASON FOR THE RAINBOW. THE WORLD BEFORE THE INTERNET. THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE POLITICAL. THERE IS NO ECONOMY ON A DEAD PLANET. EASIER DONE THAN SAID. EVERYTHING IS INFINTE. BEING HUMAN. NO MORE NOISE THAN NECESSARY. FLAMINGOS. <br><br>
